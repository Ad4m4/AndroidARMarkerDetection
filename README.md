This repository contains source code for a Java-based augmented reality marker detection application for Android. The code is largely based on the Aruco library. It depends on OpenCV4Android and a pre-setup xml configuration file containing camera intrinsics that should match the format of the OpenCV camera calibration program. Currently, the code expects the calibration file path to be "/calibration/camera.xml"
